# carv.io

Carv.io is a prediction and recommendation system for action camera videos on the web. The system consists of a web scraping front end, a feature extractor that uses metadata and computer vision (using the OpenCV library), and a machine learning stage that uses gradient boosted trees to make predictions and find the most important features for classification.
